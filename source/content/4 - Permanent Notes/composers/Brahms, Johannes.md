## Notes from June/July 2023

[Brahms (from *The Lives of the Great Composers*)](https://img.jagranjosh.com/images/2023/May/752023/who-was-johannes-brahms.webp)

- personality:  
  - brutally honest, cynical, unforgiving. no mask, often consequences.  
  - heart of gold \- the few living he respected, can move heaven & earth to help him  
  - cared little for attention, annoyed at being public foe of Wagner  
  - humble, lived simply and cheaply, sloppy clothes/hair  
- music:  
  - steel, uncompromising, solidity and weighty, serious, "pure" absolute music  
  - radiated bigness, power, thick,   
  - ignore & oppose showy, superficial, parody old music, virtuous, decorative (Wagner, Liszt, Chopin)  
  - most well versed in ways of old masters, entirely original (not copy of old formula)  
- favorite composers:  
1. BACH \- obsessed with him  
2. Beethoven \- considered his "heir", "successor", constantly compared to him  
- arduous journey in writing first symphony  
- ex-follower   
1. other old masters.  
2. living: Schumann and Clara  
- met Schumann at 20 (Schumann was 43), instant mutual admiration  
- Schumann insist Brahms move in to his house  
- insane bond wiith Clara (over Schumann \+ thought alike about music)   
- quote Schumann in 3rd symphony, had special meaning to Schumann  
-   
- education/mentor  
  - Eduard Marxsen \- lifelong friend and mentor, introduced him to Bach  
  - 2nd concerto dedicated to him  
- softened with age, rather than more adventurous/daring like beethoven

- [German Requiem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbdXd94sDiM): Lutheran Bible w/out directly being religious  
  - inspired and learned from Schütz's use of *A German Requiem* text in composition  
  - Requiem \- any piece that involves death  
    - instead of judgement/guiding of dead to afterlife, about comfort/grief/hope  
    - Brahms told a friend it ought to be sung to Schumann (sketched after his death)  
  - culmination of a decade's work conducting **amateur choir**   
    - Brahms more open/comfortable experimenting with amateur musicians  
  - "democratic" textures, all voices different viewpoints perfect harmony
