Question 1: What kind of life do you want to live in the future, and
what are your dreams? The dreams can be big, and you don\'t have to
consider whether they are achievable. But they must be what you truly
want, and you need to describe them in detail. Then draw them. For us,
we live in a big house by the sea, have as dedicated chef, and are
financially free.

road trip around US/Canada with self driving car? not super into that
idea.

as minimal packing as possible to easily sleeper train across small
country.

food, market, cycling cruises, onsen, gentle hiking, museums, etc.

hobbies? the most time and space consuming in base US home

piano

animation

oil & watercolor painting

mecha cosplay/robotics

electric cycling when I\'m too weak, safer than motorcycle at low
speeds, more fun than car designing own models/3d printing/soda can
cars/etc.

pets:

pair of quails. 2-5 years lifespan. must bond from chick to tame. how to
deal with smell/poop/stress in travel?

fostering dogs (temporary, a few months at most)
