## 1. What interests or excites you about a **career in tech**? Why do you want to participate in the Sprinternship program? What personal, academic, or professional goals will be enhanced by participating in a Sprinternship?
My excitement about a career in tech stems from its unparalleled ability to shape the future across diverse disciplines, including the arts, sciences, and beyond. As a double major in computer science and piano, I’ve always been passionate about bridging the gap between these fields. Technology, especially AI, offers a unique avenue to combine my creative and technical skills to develop innovative solutions that address real-world challenges with uniquely extensive reach potential. The idea of using AI to create tools that can enhance the way musicians practice and interpret music is a prime example of how tech can revolutionize traditional practices. For instance, I’ve been working on a project to develop an AI-driven application that uses audio recognition to match live performances to digital sheet music, helping musicians improve their ear training and interpretive skills—a task that is currently both tedious and under-emphasized in traditional music education.
Participating in the Sprinternship program is a natural next step in my journey. As a current Break Through Tech AI cohort member, I have been amazed with the indispensible resources and real-world experience this has provided. Thus, I believe this program offers the perfect opportunity to further immerse myself in a fast-paced, collaborative environment where I can apply my skills to tackle real business challenges. The chance to work on a Challenge Project with a team of fellow Sprinterns excites me because it mirrors the interdisciplinary collaboration I value so much. By engaging with professionals from multiple tech companies, I hope to gain insights into how different industries are applying AI and other technologies to solve pressing problems. This experience will not only broaden my understanding of the tech landscape but also refine my ability to work effectively in diverse teams—an essential skill as I aim to unite my musical and artistic backgrounds with my technical expertise.
Moreover, the Sprinternship program will significantly enhance my personal, academic, and professional goals. On a personal level, it will provide me with the confidence and experience needed to pursue a career that leverages AI in creative ways. Academically, the hands-on experience will complement the theoretical knowledge I’ve gained in my UCLA courses, offering a practical perspective that is often missing in the classroom. Professionally, the program will serve as a crucial stepping stone, providing me with a tech-industry credential and a network of peers and mentors that will be invaluable as I work toward launching my own AI-driven solutions for musicians. The exposure to real-world projects, combined with hands-on collaboration opportunities, will empower me to make meaningful contributions to the tech industry. 

## 2. Describe a time when you worked well on a team. What was the goal of your team? What did you contribute? What role did you play on the team? What would you do differently next time?  Please note, this can be an example from any aspect of your life: academic, professional, or extracurricular.
One of the most memorable experiences working on a team was during the development of FloraFauna (http://jzhi.bol.ucla.edu), an open-ended group project aimed at creating a crowdsourcing geographical app for wildlife enthusiasts. Our goal was to build a social media platform that united animal watching hobbyists, experts polling population data, and casual nature enthusiasts to share local wildlife spottings through photos, geographic data, and community votes on species identification. As the front-end development lead, I was responsible for designing and implementing the user interface and ensuring that the user experience was intuitive and engaging.
My role involved proposing, designing, and prototyping the layout and features of the platform. I created mockups on paper and in Figma to develop an interactive model that closely mirrored the final product. I also introduced user-friendly features, such as a "get current location" button and streamlined navigation headers, which were well-received by our user base. Additionally, I coded two of the key webpages and coordinated with the backend team to ensure seamless integration with the APIs they developed.
Our team successfully accomplished our goal, delivering a fully functional and user-friendly platform that exceeded our initial expectations. We planned and executed our tasks efficiently, capitalizing on each team member's strengths and maintaining clear communication throughout the project. The project was completed ahead of schedule, and the collaborative environment we fostered was crucial to our success.
If I were to do this project again, I would focus more on user testing early in the design process. While our team’s internal feedback was positive, conducting more extensive testing with potential users outside our team could have provided valuable insights and led to further refinements. Additionally, I would have liked to implement more iterative design reviews with the backend team, which could have streamlined our development process even more by catching potential integration issues earlier. Overall, this experience taught me the importance of collaboration, clear communication, and iterative testing in software development.

## 3. Our program intentionally fosters a safe and inclusive community that empowers women and students of all identities to break into tech. What about your lived experience motivates you to learn in this environment? How do you see yourself upholding our values of empowerment, inclusivity, community and leadership during your time in the program and beyond?
Growing up immersed in fine arts and classical music, I was naturally inclined toward a future in the arts. However, my passion for gaming, 3D modeling, and tinkering with technology sparked an unexpected journey into computer science. When I decided to double major in piano performance and computer science at UCLA, I knew I was entering uncharted territory—especially as a female student in a field where I often felt like an outsider. My experiences navigating this unconventional path have been both challenging and empowering, shaping my commitment to breaking barriers in AI.
My lived experience has taught me the importance of resilience and self-belief in overcoming impostor syndrome and the doubts of others. These challenges have motivated me to seek out environments where diversity is celebrated and where I can contribute to creating a more inclusive space for underrepresented voices. Break Through Tech AI's commitment to fostering such a community deeply resonates with me. I believe that true innovation in AI comes from diverse perspectives, which not only leads to richer solutions but also helps safeguard against biases in AI models. 
During my time in the program, I see myself upholding the values of empowerment and inclusivity by actively supporting my peers, particularly those who may feel isolated or underestimated, as I once did. I am eager to contribute my unique perspective as an artist-engineer to discussions and projects, using my interdisciplinary background to drive creative, inclusive solutions. Additionally, I aim to take on leadership roles, whether by guiding collaborative efforts or mentoring others, to help cultivate a supportive and diverse community within the program.
Beyond the program, I am committed to advocating for greater representation in AI, continuing to challenge the status quo, and developing AI-driven solutions that address real-world challenges while being mindful of the ethical implications. My goal is to empower others through technology, ensuring that AI serves all of humanity equitably and justly.
