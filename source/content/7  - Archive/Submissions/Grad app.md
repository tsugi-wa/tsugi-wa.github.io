***Instructions***

Please respond to the following. Your statement can be up to 500 words in length. You do not need to answer every question; focus on the elements that you feel are most relevant to your candidacy.

* What is your purpose in applying for graduate study in your specified degree program? Describe your area(s) of interest, including any subfield(s) or interdisciplinary interests.  
  * specifically want UCLA because of amazing current relationship with my mentor, UCLA piano head faculty, Professor Inna Faliks  
    * one-on-one lessons completely transform how i play, more relaxed, more self-confident, more creative interpretation  
    * love for piano only grew thanks to her, made incredible friends in fellow piano studio and other mentors too in theory Prof. Dante de Silva, history, chorale, wind ensemble head Dr. Travis J. Cross, etc.   
    * love performance opportunities at UCLA, i.e. orchestral accompaniment in concertos for masters, gluck fellows program (refer to gluck fellows info I provided to you in earlier chatgpt message), TA opportunities from my many TA friends, recitals, gigs, competitions, etc.  
    * firmly believe continued music education in UCLA would be best \- feel like journey just about to climax at UCLA  
    * also want UCLA (i.e. as opposed to a music conservatory) because of top Computer Science research labs like Darwiche in AI and Rosen in Bionics , the latter of which I am currently in, big passion in machine learning, full stack programming (mention one or two jargon to sound more legit and serious and like I know what I am talking about in computer science without making the grad app reviewers too confused about the meaning)  
         
* What experiences have prepared you for advanced study or research in this degree program? What relevant skills have you gained from these experiences? Have your experiences led to specific or tangible outcomes that would support your potential to contribute to this field (examples: performances, publications, presentations, awards or recognitions)?  
  * maybe mention the MPP or Chancellors recital or LA public library recital or something, but don't want to completely be redundant to my earlier draft for the Personal Statement response on diversity inclusion. omit this question if too redundant, but do try to add some unsaid points or new perspectives/thoughts about the same experiences in response to this question.   
       
* What additional information about your past experience may aid the selection committee in evaluating your preparation and aptitude for graduate study at UCLA? For example, you may wish to describe research, employment, teaching, service, artistic or international experiences through which you have developed skills in leadership, communication, project management, teamwork, or other areas.  
  * same comment as the above question.  
       
* Why is the UCLA graduate program to which you are applying is the best place for you to pursue your academic goals? If you are applying for a research master’s or doctoral program, we encourage you to indicate specific research interests and potential faculty mentors.  
  * is it appropriate to indicate my current research status in UCLA bionics lab if not pertain exactly to music program which I am applying to? make your decision in your draft response.   
       
* What are your plans for your career after earning this degree?  
  * private piano teacher to hold own studio for all ages  
    * AI smart sheet music app to combine my majors in compsci and music to make sheet music more accessible and efficient for ingrained ear and theory training practice while at the piano

The decision to pursue graduate studies in piano performance at UCLA stems from my transformative undergraduate experience under the mentorship of Professor Inna Faliks, whose guidance has reshaped my approach to music. Her instruction instilled in me greater self-confidence, individuality, and creativity in my interpretations and completely elevated my stage presence as a performer and advocate of classical music for everyone. This, combined with the vibrant community of fellow peers and other invaluable mentors I have found at UCLA—including Professor Dante De Silva of music theory and Dr. Travis J. Cross of wind ensemble—has cemented my belief that UCLA is where my artistic and academic journey should continue.  
The performance opportunities at UCLA have been life-changing \- solo and joint recitals, collaborative piano work, and programs like the Gluck Fellows, which bring music to underserved communities, have enriched both my technical abilities and my understanding of music’s role in society. I deeply value UCLA’s emphasis on diverse performance settings, from orchestral accompaniment in concerto concerts to public recitals like my recent performance at the Westwood LA Public Library, where I engaged directly with the audience by contextualizing the music for listeners of all backgrounds. These opportunities have reinforced my mission to make classical music accessible to everyone.  
UCLA’s interdisciplinary opportunities further distinguish it from other institutions. My double major in piano performance and computer science has allowed me to explore novel intersections between technology and music. Working in the UCLA Bionics Lab under Professor Jacob Rosen, I have honed skills in machine learning and full-distributed system programming to work towards improving stroke patients' accessibility to physical therapy. I have begun applying these skills to research and develop smart, AI-driven sheet music, a tool seamlessly integrated into daily instrumental practice to make theory and ear training more intuitive for all musicians. The proposal was born from observations of my needs, my classmates' own needs, our pre-existing reliance on digital tablet scores, and my piano students' needs. I aim to enhance classical music pedagogy with AI, not replace or mimic it, through synthesizing my two areas of study.  
UCLA offers a holistic environment where I can deepen my artistry while continuing my involvement in cutting-edge research. The ability to seamlessly integrate my dual passions makes UCLA the ideal place for me to pursue graduate studies.  
Looking ahead, I aspire to establish a private piano studio for students of all ages, cultivating young individuals' passion for music. I also aim to bring my interdisciplinary expertise to the broader music community through technology, developing tools that enhance practice and pedagogy. By combining my experiences as a performer, educator, and researcher, I hope to inspire the next generation of musicians while addressing gaps in accessibility in both music and technology.  
UCLA has been the foundation of my growth as a musician and innovator. I am eager to deepen my contributions to its vibrant community while advancing a future where classical music and technology synthesize to inspire and empower learners and listeners alike.

Music is often described as a universal language, but its opportunities for learning and participation are far from universal. During my time at UCLA, I experienced this firsthand while volunteering with the UCLA Music Partnership Program (MPP). Each week, I traveled to the Boys and Girls Club to teach piano to students from underrepresented communities in Hollywood—a city renowned for its rich artistic legacy but where access to public music education remains uneven. For many, MPP was their first chance to express themselves creatively in a personal, one-on-one setting. We imagined stories behind the music, improvised familiar melodies, and celebrated every milestone together to foster confidence and curiosity. I witnessed how early exposure to music unlocked new pathways for some of my students who had never imagined themselves pursuing higher education in the arts until now—a vital step toward more inclusive higher education in music.  
Beyond teaching, I have sought to bring classical music to wider audiences, bridging the gap between this art form and communities that might not have regular exposure to it. When I performed a free solo recital at the LA Public Library, I introduced each piece with fun historical facts and personal reflections to make the "sacred" music more approachable. People of all ages and backgrounds filled the library. Afterward, many shared their personal connections to my program—a lady told me it was the first time she’d heard live classical music and asked for a selfie; an elderly audience member shared memories of playing the same piece on guitar once. Moments like these remind me that music has the power to connect us in ways that transcend language, upbringing, or education. Whether performing at community venues or recitals for retired UCLA faculty, I am driven by the belief that classical music should be accessible to all.  
My commitment to equity began long before I understood its meaning by befriending special education classmates often excluded by other kids due to taboos. I had simply believed in treating them like a fellow peer. I especially remember Shruvi, a girl with a big personality despite her severe stunting of growth. One Christmas, I gave her a purple stuffed elephant—her favorite color. Small gestures like these taught me the importance of uplifting the less fortunate. Since then, I've adopted the tradition of dedicating portions of my earnings to Feeding America and Make-A-Wish Foundation every Thanksgiving. I also joined UCLA’s Bionics Research Lab as a computer scientist, where I work on automating physical therapy for stroke patients.  
As a piano and computer science double major, I bring a uniquely interdisciplinary perspective to my work. Through my course experience and continued interest in digital humanities, I aim to conduct research on inclusive teaching strategies and on how accessible music education impacts cognitive development, self-confidence, and emotional well-being in systematically marginalized populations. Through teaching, research, and performance, I am committed to using my platform as a musician and educator to foster inclusivity and inspire the next generation of scholars, musicians, and community leaders.
