Discover Your Unique Voice in Piano! UCLA Classical Pianist and CompSci Double Major on Full Scholarship—Rooted in Tradition, Inspired by Individuality.
### About you:
With over 16 years of continuous private instruction from:
- Dr. Inna Faliks, Head of the UCLA piano department and celebrated international pianist
- Professor Hans Boepple, Chair of the Department of Music of Santa Clara University, Steinway International Artist since 1982
- My Grandmother, Shanghai Conservatory of Music Professor and Graduate

At UCLA, I’ve earned a full-ride Music Scholarship, a Boeing Scholarship from PSAT, and various music award scholarships for my outstanding performances.

I've linked one of my performances below. My repertoire spans from Baroque to Contemporary, reflecting my belief that there's gems to be found in any period that speak to you in particular. My goal is to help students discover, express, and enjoy themselves through their gems and gradually come to own them.

I aim to celebrate the inherent, characteristic creativity of my students while instilling essential, rewarding practicing habits. After all, my love for piano began from improvising and experimenting to my heart's content with my granny over Skype. Playing piano is all about the freedom and joy in expressing yourself through the music you love. 

### About the lesson:

I'm happy to tailor lessons for all levels—beginners to collegiate—to ensure each student is equipped to play to their heart's content. We’ll choose pieces that align with your tastes, goals, and skill level, and I’ll provide practical strategies from my personal experience to address any challenges you may face.

The process of learning any piece involves three main aspects—technique, musicality, and artistry—and we’ll build your skills in each area step by step. I adjust lessons based on your progress, as I believe in taking the time to help you build confidence in your interpretation of each piece. 

I’m excited to help you explore and enjoy your piano journey. Let’s make meaningful music together!


I am happy to tailor lesson plans to students anywhere from beginner to collegiate level. I want students to be equipped with everything they need to play to their heart's content. This involves repertoire selection that not only reflect the student's goals and tastes but also are at the sweet spot for their difficulty level. I will recommend practice strategies that best target  specific challenges students may face that were indispensable in my experience as a student. 
The skills of the pianist on a given piece can be divided into three areas by an approximate sequential order - physical, musical, and artistic, and I believe it is important to take one's time building confidence in all three for every piece, one at a time. I strongly believe that the pacing of lessons for students must be adjusted accordingly.

### Title:
Classical UCLA piano and CompSci double major on full-ride scholarship with multiple competition awards, top scores in MTAC and collegiate music theory. Years of teaching experience w/ grades K-8

### About you:
Hello, I am a 3rd year undergraduate in the UCLA Herb Alpert School of Music. I've had 16 continuous years of private instruction from notable professors like the head of the UCLA piano department, Inna Faliks, and the Chair of Department of Music of Santa Clara University, Hans Boepple. You can hear some of my performances in the video below.  
  
I am currently studying under a full ride music scholarship as well as a Boeing scholarship for my computer science double major. Notable awards I have received are first place of the 23rd (2023) UCLA Rubinyi Scholarship Competition as well as northern regional winner of the MTAC piano concerto competition, division III. I have a very diverse repertoire under my belt and am always looking to expand my piano techniques and colors.  
  
I also have a strong background in musicianship and theory, placing out of first-year UCLA music theory and getting 149/150 on the MTAC CM advanced level theory exam. However, I aim to find the balance between encouraging inherent, individual creativity and emphasizing the importance of disciplined, detail-oriented practicing, since I've had extremely rewarding experiences under mentors of both worlds. My relationship with piano began with improvising and experimenting to my heart's content with my grandmother over Skype, after all. And after my skills were meticulously sharpened throughout my pre-college years, I am rediscovering what playing piano is all about - the immense freedom and joy in expressing yourself through the music you love. So I hope to share my love of piano and guide you along a wonderfully rewarding piano journey

### About the lesson:
At a typical lesson, we will work on pieces that not only reflect the student's goals and tastes but also are at that sweet spot to push their current skills. I will recommend a few drills and practice strategies that best target any unique, personal challenges they may face that were indispensable in my experience as a student. The skills of the pianist on a given piece can be divided into three areas by an approximate sequential order - technicality, musicality, and artistry, and I believe it is important to take one's time building confidence in them for every piece, one at a time. As such, I understand that the pacing of students and their individual pieces must be adjusted accordingly.
