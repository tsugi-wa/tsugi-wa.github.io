UCLA Music Partnership Program: Instructor Application Form

Thanks for your interest in the UCLA Music Partnership Program. Please complete this application, and we'll be in touch with more information soon. Please also feel free to contact afox@schoolofmusic.ucla.edu if you have any questions, thanks!


**Do you have any experience teaching on your primary or other instruments? Please explain below.** 
Yes. I had one student who was a fellow UCLA undergrad interested in studying piano as a hobby for a quarter. I would give feedback and practicing guidance after hearing the short pieces that she had learned the previous week. She was beginner-intermediate level and already knew how to read sheet music. I also went over some basic theory but only when relevant to her understanding the piece to align with her goals rather than to give her a formal comprehensive education in music theory, musicianship, etc. I also gave her piece recommendations that were suitable to her level and let her choose. 

**Who is your primary UCLA teacher or advisor?** Professor Inna Faliks

**Languages Spoken:** English, Mandarin

**Please describe any previous teaching, volunteer, and community engagement work experience:**
In my 14 years training formally as a classical pianist and winning first place at the 2023 UCLA Benno Rubinyi competition, I've also realized how equally rewarding it is to share my music extracurricularly. In high school, I collaborated with a classmate violinist to perform concerts for Aegis Living senior home residents. Their warm embrace of our music inspires me to this day, where I volunteer every quarter to give a half-hour recital to retired UCLA faculty at the Chancellor's home.
I have 3 years of experience teaching students grades K-8 math and reading at Kumon during high school. I held brief curriculum lessons with students and proctored exams. I also guided students through the math and reading problems in their homework in class. I would grade student work, take attendance, and give hints for wrong answers to encourage them to fully understand and correct their work. 

**Do you feel more comfortable teaching in a group format or 1-on-1 with students?**
1-on-1 Instruction

**Please briefly describe why you are interested in participating in the Music Partnership Program:**
I am interested because it aligns with my passion for both music and community engagement. As a dedicated piano performance major, I have experienced the profound impact that music can have on individuals and communities. I am eager to share my knowledge and love for music with younger students, particularly those who might not have had the opportunity to receive formal music education. Teaching allows me to not only reinforce my own understanding but also to inspire and nurture the next generation of musicians. I believe that music education is a powerful tool for personal and communal growth, and I am committed to contributing to the program’s mission of fostering musical talent and appreciation to the most underserved communities in LA.

**Do you have a reliable method of transportation (i.e. a car)? If not, are you able to take public transportation which may take upwards of 2 hours roundtrip?**
Yes. I plan to bike and take public transportation as needed.

**What other activities are you involved in on campus (i.e. sports, clubs, Greek life, other work, etc.)?**
I am a computer science and piano performance double major. In UCLA's Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) AI branch and Society of Women Engineers (SWE) clubs, I organized hackathons and connected with industry panelists, interns, and my now invaluable mentor, a fellow female currently working in tech. Both participating and helping guide these inclusive communities have been immensely enriching in sparking my passion for AI and expanding my collaborating and developing skills. I'm also proud to have been selected by the T. Howard Diversity-TECH program for my qualities. 
This summer I am a researcher at the UCLA bionics lab for automating physical therapy of stroke patients in the comfort of their home. I also am interning for the summer at GumGum, an artificial intelligence tech and advertisement company at Santa Monica. My aim is to gain invaluable workplace experience in both of my academic areas of study, as I have been told by my piano teachers that my ability to phrase key points in lessons and patience are great qualities for teaching. 
This may be outside of campus, but my piano professor and a fellow studio-mate and friend all went to Siena, Italy this summer for the Chigiana music academy's piano intensive program. I learned a great deal from the juxtaposing of unique teaching styles from each of the four piano professors within the program and it was truly inspirational to me. My plans to pursue a teaching career in the instrument I love are now solidified. 


_**Please note that the Music Partnership Program expects you to teach for three consecutive hours per week. The required three hours does not include transportation to and from your assigned site, which could take up to two hours roundtrip._**
