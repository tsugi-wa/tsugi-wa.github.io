## Software Process Models
- waterfall model (hardware)
	- strictly sequential, dont go forward or backwards
	- better for hardware, which is more expensive to change
	- **v-model:** always write test case with each step of waterfall
		- only go up testing AFTER reach bottom of v
- incremental model (all knowns)
	- break down major requirements into multiple increments of time + their expectations
	- can overlap (not strictly sequential)
	- **RAD model:** know exactly what is needed, dev. in parallel highly efficient
- iterative (very unknown_)
	- rely heavily on customer response
	- hard to predict finish line
	- can lead to costly redesign!!!! 
	- **spiral model:** 4 phases: Planning, Risk Analysis, Dev, Evals 
		- each spiral leads to the mini release, not defined finish date
- Agile (incremental+iterative)
	- pretend to know what is necessary (ie. timing)
	- manifesto: community driven, self-imposed rules
	- prioritize customer, as collaborator not contractor
	- more flexible, against early writing docs, costly redesign
- Scrum 
	- backlog -> sprint planning+backlog (2 weeks) with daily standup
	- end of sprint: review and retrospective
	- scrum team: 7-9 ppl bubble led by scrum master
	- **product owner:** btwn scrum master and clients/stakeholders
		- knows customer base/market, gaming guru if developing game
		- creates backlog, not how to do it
