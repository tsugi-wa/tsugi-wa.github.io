speculation without owning any stock

Tesla Bull thinks in 3 months, tesla will grow
finds opposite guy (tesla bear)
the two enter agreement - tesla bull can by from tesla bear (at agreed, exercise price) 

## Call Option: option to buy at predetermined price
tesla 165-->190,  exercise/strike price=\$165 and options premium=\$10
- me: buys $165 stocks from them (earns $190-$165-$10 = $15)
- them: loses \$25-\$10=\$15 
tesla 165-->150, exercise price=$165 and options premium=$10
- me: doesn't buy at $165 because $150 better price (loses premium=$10)
- them: earns $10

## Put Option: option to sell at predetermined price
exercise price=$165-->$140
- me: sells $165 stock to them (earns $165-140-$10=$15)
- them: loses $25-$10=$15
$165-->180
- me: doesn't sell at $165 because $180 better price (loses premium=$10)
- them: earns $10

## Premium determining (constantly fluctuating)
- factors:
	- intrinsic value: 
		- i.e. underlying stock=$100,  options=$10
		- if underlying stock $100--> $120 (+20%),  options $10-->$25 (+150%)
		- if underlying stock $100--> $80 (-20%), options $10-$1 (-90%) 
	- time of expiration (more time = more \$\$)
		- weekly, monthly, or quarterly options
	- implied volatility so far : (more volatile = more \$\$)
		- ![[Pasted image 20241118152025.png#invert]]
		- more risk of stock owner = higher premium
- option buyer (me:  unlimited upside, max loss of premium) option seller reversed
- examples of premium costs for 30 day 100 shares in relation to current market price![[Pasted image 20241118151603.png#invert]]
	- puts want it to go down from strike price, calls want it to grow from strike price
	- if still out of money when expired: worthless (loss = premium)
		- ![[Pasted image 20241118151959.png#invert]]
- can exercise at any time before expiration
- at expiration however, anything out of the money
