# old vs new blurb:
I am a 3rd year at UCLA. I am a Computer Science and Piano Performance double major and professional painter. My unique blend of skills in machine learning frontiers, fine art, and music allow me to approach challenges with a well-rounded perspective. I am excited to connect with like-minded enthusiasts to explore innovative AI applications across various industries.

Hi, I'm a junior undergraduate at UCLA majoring in Computer Science and Piano Performance. I'm an engineering Deans Honors list awardee in 2023 and winner of the full-ride UCLA Shera and Peter Falk Lt. Columbo Memorial Scholarship. I'm proficient in C++, Java, MySQL, and developing full-stack, multi-tiered apps. I've also worked in Python, Node.js, and Kotlin/Android. I'm seeking to demonstrate my technical experience, adaptability, and commitment to learning.

resume is flyer NOT holistic like linkedin, build brand w/ quality info
about: summarize achievements and aspirations, call to action? 
	statement: purposeful, inspiring, extremely personal unique, etc.

very upfront; admit I am not finance guy, but here I bleieve my skills are this and this in data analysis skills, so interview questions adjusted to be more data analytical 
behaviorial - specific challenge in this experience and what you learn
- understanding terms bring to interviewer's level not too technical in behavior etc. 
- exaggerate a specific dimension portraying yourself (upbeat college kid really enthusiastic to learn, take initiative, talk about example that highlights this)
