# Schatz - Hollywood Genres Ch 8: Douglas Sirk and the family melodrama: Hollywood baroque
- Sirk's glossy stylistic melodramas underrated long time in America critics 1950-1959 films
- thanks to mainly 'weepie" audience - middle-aged, middle-class middlebrow "women's matinee" crowd
- strong aesthetics and dramatic theory and experience of film history and criticism
- Sirk's opinion of Imitation of Life book: at odds of other melodramaists, narrator took american success ethic, romantic love, nuclear family seriously while Sirk criticised it
- huge profits from Sirk's films that critique American ideology the most including his last, Imitation of Life
- thrived on adversity, on being assigned by studio bosses not independent like others, outrageous scripts and dehumanizing working conditions "impossible stories"
- distinct style from his "orchestra" of talents and production unit with same cinematographer, msuical director, set designer, art director, costume designer, and company of actors
- interior framing used to portray female characters as entrapped socially and materially (i.e. window frame, staircase prison)

## Sirk as stylist
- camera and lighting, Russel Metty
- unlike others who viewed melodramas as reflection of real life and thus as realistic as possible, Sirk very stylized to show artifice and camera's unnatural detached gaze
- unnatural lighting to remind audience it is fiction - applied Brecht's notion of audience alienation 
- subverts audience expectations of realism to show how neat bow endings of social problems can only exist in movies
	- both for audience to identify with reflected reality, and to manipulate, distort, interpret, shape, stylize world in the image of filmmaker's vision
- same with everything else, decor, costumes, set ,actors, plot
- to depict romantic love in social circumstances - social commentary, left unresolved unlike the romances for unsatisfactory resolutions "unhappy happy end" encourage viewer to think afterwards

## All that heaven allows
- characters wearing clothing color-keyed to immediate surroundings in beginning, thematic significance in material objects
- melodrama: one immovable character against which you can put your more split ones
- casting choices: Hudson's beefcake charm and acting limitations become advantages not debits (narrative assets), or John Wayne casted for his overwhelming screen persona 
- Hudson personification of genre's version of American values, unaffected, mythic figure, static, 1D narrative foil
## Imitation of Life
- aggressive, self-reliant woman bent upon surviving in a mans world, Lora Meredith widow, mother, aspriing actress takes daughter and life savings to NYC for stage career
- watershed film - ultimate woman film success saga widow/daughter opposition, + racisim and feminism heavy topics displacing nuclear family
- can be viewed as perverse social comedy dangerously close to parody, suffering heroine least engaging of Sirk's victimized women, sirk displeased with melodrama narrative limitations
- histrionic performance and outlandish cliches for early career setbacks, stardom, parenting, etc., characteristic irony
- balanced by Juanita Moore's Annie Johnson, stoic sturdy black woman widow-mother-maid and Sara Jane the daughter trying to pass as white and rejects mother as all her memories of being black were painful
- both widowhood working women but Annie is Lora's maid so domesticator
- first movement: after WWII,Lora and Annie agree to live together
- second: conventional sucess story montage, cope with family and success (daughter leaes, Annie dies from the strain)
- ending: Lora believes success worthless without love (marriage and compromising career), Sara convinced love meaningless without success (denying black heritage and thus mother-love)
- when Annie dies, both worlds collapse and congregate with heartfelt but ultimately hopeless reunion (barely running when Annie alive, unlikely works when dead) - underlying hopelessness
	- not supposed to believe the artificial "happy ending", don't have to go through this
	- as we seen their values and behavior governed by unavoidable social conditions
- Anne - ironic pathetic plight of woman devoted life to family
- reunion includes pursuitor of Lora who is always rejected in favor of Lora's career - immovable macho hero inmelodrama just petrified statue of timeless honesty integrity understanding facade "you haven't changed a bit"
- constant delicate balance between internal narrative logic and real-world plausibility, periodically distancing us for thematic impact
- Even within the relatively inflexible realm of the family melodrama, Sirk refined a style, a narrative attitude, a self-conscious view of life that demands more from us than the passive consumption of escapist entertainment. 
- He teaches us that we never really escape, not even in the slick, artificial realm he creates, the social and human conditions determining our own roles within the fascinating fiction of American life

# Kennedy - Imitation of Life (1959)
remake of 1934 would fly in 50s? Ross Hunter suggest capitalize on scandal of Lana Turner, scandal when mafioso boyfriend fatally stabbed by her underage daughter.
- first day shooting with press, carried herself regally demanding respect, and lavishly treated by studio
- 1933 vnovel of pairs of mother-daughters 
- While Hunter combed over the source material, and even toyed with transferring it into a Broadway musical, director Douglas Sirk conceptualized without reading the book or seeing the original film.
- key changes made, instead of sharing food business, story moved to glamor of NYC theater, no opportunity for Annie to break from subservient role of food business commenting of racial hierarchy Sirk
- lora succeeds as actress at cost of relationship with daughter and rejecting John Gavin rock hudson mold playing lora's love interest and daughter's girlhood crush
- more compelling relationship of Annie and daughter via exploring race and identity
	- sara jane immediately abandon heritage for racial privilege, film doesn't condemn her
	- instead enforces consequences if she owns her identities in racist America
	- Lora and Annie dear friends but always reality of inequality, write checks to the other, receives glory or toils
	- quiet sadness for unyielding social division of american life
	- stoicism shattered by daughter rejection not by day to day racisim
- sirk escaped nazi regimewith jewish wife in 1937, outsider's perspective detail-oriented
- critique both white and black, can't escape what you are -. social consciousnesss
	- his quote: ""You can't escape what you are…. I tried to make it into a picture of social consciousness – not only of a white social consciousness, but of a Negro one, too. Both white and black are leading imitated lives… There is a wonderful expression: seeing through a glass darkly. Everything, even life, is inevitably removed from you. You can't reach, or touch, the real. You just see reflections. If you try to grasp happiness itself your fingers only meet glass. It's hopeless.""
- masterful play of controlled emotions and visual symbolism, Hunter's gauzy lens vs Sirk layered commentary on life's vicissitudes
- sirk uneasy with grand ending unlike hunter who just wanted racial themes to invoke audience tears not critique political consciousness
- sirk retired and rejected offers after this movie, had had enough
