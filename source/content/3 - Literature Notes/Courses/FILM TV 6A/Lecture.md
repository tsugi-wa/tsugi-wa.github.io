- variety show in theatre
- comedy, music, juggling, large animals, tapdancers, strongmen, magicians, etc.
- lower class, raunchy humor but more respectable over time (vs burlesque/strip-tease )
- origin from France and 1800s minstrelsy (theater)
- commercial motion pictures render vaudeville obsolete
	- vaudeville theatres converted to film theatres,
	- very little authentic film record of vaudevilles
	- many didn't survive their fame after 1920s
- **influence:** 
	- in film, i.e. Charlie Chaplin who adapted vaudeville experience to film
	- in TV, Milton Berle acts

Vs Theatrical (NOT attraction)
- Traditional stage design (mise en scène)
- Presence onstage (proscenium stage)
- Long shots
- Artificial sets
- Actors facing audience

Shift to Narrative/Ideology 
- Perspective i.e. flattering/unflattering 
- Racism, capitalism, poverty

	- [The Immigrant (Chaplin, 1917)](https://youtu.be/HWmtKIix4jY?si=NW6xkxROO6fxdqc9) advocating cross-class equality
