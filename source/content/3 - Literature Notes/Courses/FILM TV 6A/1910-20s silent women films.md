#  1910-20s silent women films
Photo of women vs men director portraying themselves - male director individual genius against a monument vs female craft-focused with a team
Implicit capitalism - inherent wealthy white man > less wealthy colored women for example

- both form (narration style, camera framing) and content (plot, characters) contribute to marginalized races in Hollywood films
- Lots of melodramas focus on white family with black servants/villains
- 1910s: immigrant/working class to 1920s: middle class
- Stereotype of strong active men (Douglas Fairbanks) and passive women
- Big 5 studios vs small 3 studios
- How Jews defined Hollywood and thus American culture

Victorian gender ideals and consumerism
1. the Cheat (Cecile B. demille, 1915) promoting consumer culture directed by guy
   1. Japanese Sessue Hayakawa rare Asian icon in Hollywood, first non white actor with international fame and leading man
   2. Had first onscreen interracial kiss b4 motion production outlawed it in 30s
   3. Still suffer from Hollywood racism and portrayed a villain beyond his wishes 
   4. Ppl uproar because say he was negative stereotype so re released in 18 to be Burmese king
2. The Consequences of Feminism (Alice Guy-Blache 1906) framing differences 
   1. Experimental role reversal of men and women 
   2. Serious critique of men by showing women neglecting household, etc but presenting as absurdist silly humor 
   3. Ending implies restoring order/societal roles is the solution 

The race for the sausage by Alice Guy
“Be Natural: The Untold Story of Alice Guy-blache)

# movie reactions
Marriage in progress, de mill particularly fascinated by that
Agency and autonomy for women roles in de Mille vs other films 
Early cinema great prmise of tech inventions trusts and stars of modernism 
De Mille woman protagonist more revealing than dw griffith fully covered

## Sklar Charlie c
### Ch 2
Charlie Chaplin, Mary Pickford, Douglas Fairbanks and dw griffith own film studio United Arts Corp independent instead of big 5 monopoly

### Ch 3
Forming studio system (motion patent company 1908) to monopolize movie making invention Equipment theaters etc
Hollywood vertical monopoly born from Edison patent busted

5 changes:
1. end of nickelodeons & beginning of picture "palaces"
2. Movie audiences became more universal
3. Short (1-reel) films replaced by feature-length films
4. Trust replaced by independents
5. Industry moved to Hollywood for 3 reasons
   * More sunshine
   * More diverse geography
   * Cheaper labor
* Industry organized by studio system, characterized by OLIGOPOLY & VERTICAL INTEGRATION

Huge lavish production stages meant for top down grandeur films 

**modern times (Chaplin, 1936)**
Eaten by machine cog in industrialism but of course under comedic effect 
Don’t need lot of stuff to be happy is the msg
Boss spying on Chaplin scene when he is ok break, critique Ford’s assembly line and Taylorism monitoring workers for more profit
Compare modern times - dream of working class marriage ideal, dealing with sympathetic woman stealing bananas to feed Vs 
Cecile Demille “The Cheat” 1915 and “Madam Satan” 1930
* In end wife is foolish but punish the husband trying to protect her and take the blame - okay to lynch Asian guy?
* Much subtler message of wife being bored from no fulfilling purpose as woman role in marriage with man working all the time, so seduced by Asian guy exciting “exotic” provocative guy
* Madam Satan - shows demille’s more fashion forward movies. Very focused on woman lead, authoritative seductive woman Avant guard, no longer Victorian conservative views of marriage and modesty 
* 
# Discussion 2
Body and Soul (1925) 
- race film = made by / made for non white ppl by independent not studio (indie)
- Big selling point ie “The Homesteader” “all-star negro cast” alternative to stereotypical depictions 
- Paul Robeson star, peaked in 30s-40s with bass baritone voice

Women
- sudden drop in women casting from 40 to 20% in 1930 vs 1910-20
- Because of studio system not as grass roots as before (big studio)

Train is miniature + live action extras

“German expressionist” influence -  from Geuropean background creators (i.e. Murray and Klaus Strau, miniature cityscape

Even vehicular POV moving car miniatures

Amazing matte shot

Non wide angle lenses yet so forced perspective, sets with floors sloped up, sizing of bulbs, etc. children dressed as adults

 (Cafe scene)
SLO mo: higher frame rate to show drowning effect

Hollywood removed “Best Unique and Artistic Picture” award bc less “effficient” and promotes creative out of box ideas
