[Communication with Noteboxes An Empirical Account By Niklas Luhmann](https://www.scottscheper.com/zettelkasten/)
# Section I: Intro
- impossible to think without writing (sophisticated/networked) to capture distinctions in concepts
- schema to process info? 
- only mutual surprise by external brain or you can info be gained
	- even if (and more so when) info systems not same, diff goals
- long-term partner: open vs thematic specialization? of course open, need some chaos

# Section II: Slipbox
- against systematic ordering via topics/subtopics but firm fixed place ([Stellordnung](https://www.reddit.com/r/Zettelkasten/comments/16njtfx/comment/k1epvxt/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button))
	- index overdoing vs Luhmann's method = only topical engagement NOT transtopical (categorical vs idea-centered)
	- always balancing order and chaos, only do minimum to work!  simplist solution for complexity of thought, NOT other way around!
- instead, register of keywords linking to stuff (index)
	- key-value associative array
	-
