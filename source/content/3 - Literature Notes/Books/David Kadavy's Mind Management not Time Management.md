# Ch 1
creativity not just in art - coming up both **novel** and **useful** item
interdisciplinary or outcomes hard to measure best against job stealing from AI  
**time worship**, Taylorism industrialism woven into our interpreting of all else  
Time is not a commodity: time not used now pays dividend later  
## what to do at 3:21pm?  
1. Context? Phone or computer  
2. Time available  
3. Energy available? In mood of pesky details? Creative? Analytical?  
4. Priority  

Fully take advantage of mind management? 
	Looks like: easily feel current mood and know what is best to do now.  go with flow, aligned with mind dissolve procrastination
Sometimes a task simply too urgent: 
	what mood most conducive for this work? When last time i was on that mood? How can I replicate conditions?
	
like twisting hands to play piano, train to attune to mind 
change mood how? find patterns in day?
separate task into **sub-tasks** based on mood

## why did he move?
**vicktor frankl** quote, anyone who discovers creative work knows why for his existence and can bear any how.  he knew why: write book. how?  without writing books depressed neglect relationships so moved to new continent

# ch 2: creative sweet spot
## Insight vs analytical?
creative work so unpredictable, not linear progress. iterative thru stages
mental states of day, creative cycles up and down, system? 
creating in chaos of life
## divergent vs convergent:
first divergent, association in big picture
then convergent, deep focus to narrow the options
**word triad**: test creativity via divergent thinking - INSIGHT sudden out of nowhere? eureka
- saw flash of activity on right side of brain in "ah-ha" moment
- insight not necessarily useful so != creativity (convergent's job to test)
- association words, some connections very strong (highways) but can also lights adjacent streets/connections in brain. 
obvious connections are OBSTACLES to novel ideas
## Biological Rhythms
diminishing returns, negative returns
Time not **fungible**: from where did you take time? entire width of bridge 1 inch or parallel? still works?
**biological rhythms** 
- tired early afternoon. "that 2-30 feeling".  real scientific reasons.
- 2-4 hrs intense in morning, then looser later for all world class violinist schedules
- consistent routines common trait among great creators
creative work - not necessarily at most alert. prefrontal cortex - willpower kills creativity???
- do creative thinking @ collision of ideas instead of trying to control everything
- thus creative thinking best in the MORNING, sleep inertia
- cons:
	- more easily distracted by surroundings - boring wall
	- computer temptations - dedicate to "first hour" rule, habitually improves day
- **FIRST HOUR RULE**** most important project *only* , first hour of day.  NOT CHECK SOCIAL MEDIA EVEN. ripples to rest of day
- like airport blank slate or spin top at center longer, blank slate, start on big win
- first hour divergent brainstorming groggy sleep inertia, then next few hours peak of cognitive activity so convergent analytical thinking, start off day feeling good

## clock-time vs event-time
something goes horribly wrong but then feel like in new plane of existence, calm
clock-time vs event-time: like Italy is event-time, America is clock-tim culturral diference
- make appointment a week from today, "in 8 days"???? today is event.  day of appointment also event. 1+6+1
work out eventually so okay, Columbian thinking (nothing will happen - stop worrying)
- event-time better for what trying to accomplish: thinking of gift option
- analytical thinking is jogging path, creativity insights maze with portals 
- Columbians in the mood, feel happier no time pressure
business reduces creativity for several days into future not just that day

use units of times to guide you to fulfilling life. cannot race against time, just go along with 1 hr a day, etc.
