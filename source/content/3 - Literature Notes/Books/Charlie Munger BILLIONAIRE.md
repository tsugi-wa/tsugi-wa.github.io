## Attempt 1 to write about Charlie Munger:

Charlie Munger's distinct character was evident from a young age. Described by his classmate Gross as pompous long before he was wealthy, he was strongly opinionated and self-confident since youth. He was always concentrated wholly on the facts; he wouldn't back down if he knew his viewpoint was superior and yet his opinions weren't set in stone in the presence of a better argument. He had an unwavering individuality about him, and his business partners could trust that his viewpoint would be unfettered by conventional thinking thanks to his ability to think through future events and come to conclusions different from what others assumed it would be. His daughter said that he represented the social values that are hard to find in the business world. He was passionately seeking riches for the freedom, not ferraris, and constantly juggled parenting his eight children, risky real estate investments around southern california, lawyering, and his vast interests in complexity, analysis, and bygone geniuses (through books). And yet, he didn't have an ego that prevented him from recognizing Buffett's investing genius and surprised people by taking on a subordinate role to Warren.  
I think his distinct character is partially hereditary and partially from his upbringing from being exposed all his life to lawyerly thinking. He came from a line of middle class frontiers. His paternal grandfather Judge Munger was a hard financial conservative but progressive judge, doing everything he could to move his family as far as possible from the early poverty he experienced. Charlie's grandparents were strong believers in discipline, self-sufficiency, and morality and taught them through books like Robinson Crusoe. Books were always a major part of his life \- Charlie went on to absorb the countless biographies he read and modeled his behavior after many greats, especially Benjamin Franklin. As a result, he was certainly the polymath in the Munger and Buffett duo, which added to his striking resemblance to Buffett's retired mentor Ben Graham. His level of utter concentration and his constantly running mind is truly admirable as well, as he couldnt help but think over a problem if it came to his attention. The book explained how he wowed his clients with a well thought out process of thinking up three possible solutions to a dispute and guiding them through the best situation in a timely manner.   
When his freshman year at college was interrupted by him joining the Army during WWII, he scored exceptionally high on the IQ test but was lacking in mechanical aptitude. This confirmed that he was not fit for a career like surgery. He also took note of the many role model adults in his life, of which there were many. He was close friends with his father's best friend and top surgeon, Dr. Davis, and knew he didn't have the mechanical skill to be an exceptional surgeon like him. Charlie was excelling at his classes but noticed his math professor was far more apt in the field than he so he looked elsewhere. He had great admiration for the sciences, especially physics, because it taught him the ways of fully devoted concentration in thinking through a problem (assiduity), but knew the field wasn't for him. He knew what he wanted, took a good look at what skills he had at his disposal, and chose the path that he would be most exceptional in: law. Munger came to Harvard Law School after pleading his case to a family friend, but he vastly preferred the teachings of the "eminent dead better than the live teachers" and thus rushed through school. He also made the bold, surprising choice to move to Pasadena, where his father had considered moving to but decided against. He and his father had the keen eye to see that LA had far greater business prospects for him than in the smaller city of Omaha where his family and family friends were already well established lawyers, doctors, etc.   
Since you like to compare living life to playing cards, it seems to me that Munger is the ultimate genius to do this at such a young age as if he's played the life game millions of times before. And the book did say he learned to play poker in the army which helped him greatly in his business later on. The book makes it look so simple \- a checklist of professions, process of elimination via his innate skills, and boom\! He chose law. And yet he was able to somehow do real estate investing as a **part-time activity?\!** True, he quit after 5 huge construction projects because it was proving very risky and nerve-racking, but it is insane that he would confidently go into law school, speed through it and focus on self-learning instead to jump into a city thousands of miles away from home, then do both law and investing at the busiest stage of one's life \- raising kids, divorcing, remarrying, struggling to rebuild his wealth, etc?? It makes me think what's up with me? I have the innate talents to strive to be a "polymath" (just learned this term) but have a blind eye when it comes to my state of affairs let alone the current world's state of affairs. He is constantly thinking-I am sure it would kill him to be idle for too long. He's constantly thinking about the present, past, future, his investment mistakes buying and flipping doomed business, his lessons learned in the true value of investing in costly but good businesses, thinking about the current market, trying risky things without fear, stoically working through extremely tough times caused by bad luck or his own mistakes without fuss, etc. I feel like I am only scratching the surface of this great man's life and infinite wisdom.
