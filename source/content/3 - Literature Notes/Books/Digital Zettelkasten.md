Description: practical example of zettelkasten workflow & tips
---
## Purpose, Worth Time? 
- Computers are bicycle of the mind? no more like bumper cars
- database of your knowledge and insights at tip of memory, 
	- [NOT wikipedia](https://www.reddit.com/r/Zettelkasten/comments/vllinf/is_wikipedia_a_zk_why_bother_then/)/google ([[David Kadavy - Digital Zettelkasten_ Principles, Methods, & Examples (2021).pdf#page=19|pg 19]]), want personal cool associations of info
	- NOT library catalog, no end destination "note"
- EXAMPLES of using zettelkasten
	- jog and solidify your own memory, not substitution NOT PERSONAL WIKI/INFO MANAGEMENT
	- answer question "why on the one hand museums are empty, while on the other hand exhibitions of paintings by Monet, Picasso, or Medici are too crowded"
- [[-Indistractible by Nir Eyal]]: humans always prone to distractions, so feed it with small notes on the go (fleeting notes)
- **follow your curiosity productively:** link to future texts want to read ex
- not boring or slog if rewriting in own words, like training wheels to blank page writing
- think ASSOCIATIVELY esp when adding keywords, links
- Paper vs Digital Zettelkasten:
    - paper more unpreventable cons (i.e. portability, speed, backup, etc).
    - digital limits: distractions, feel, retention via handwriting
# Constructing Your Zettelkasten:
![[diagrams.png#invert]]
- Titles?
	-  meaningful phrase: "Is ego depletion real"
	- + some id (i.e." Data search? \#Question"
- Fleeting notes:
	- **[Readwise](https://docs.readwise.io/readwise/docs/exporting-highlights/obsidian)** exports book highlight to inbox then **highlight the highlights**! (bold)
	- spot missing info in text & have own questions while reading
	- random vocab words or words that joy memory
	- particular passage good in free writing
- Literature Notes:
	- rewrite highlights export from book to take away from
	- help understand material, internalize & polish
	- highly encourage digital books be tools
- Permanent Notes:
	- atomic idea. with synthesized thoughts
	- link to others, source from lit. notes w/keywords that jog the memory (i. e. Iowa, F. I. R. E)
	- keywords: not by appropriateness (archivist) but by
	- what you care about (writer): \#TimePressure
	- keywords!
		- not think like archivist! unique, meaning to **YOU**
		- coin your own terms i. e. \#IcebergPrinciple (highest quality writing only tip of iceberg of work/knowledge)
# Adapting to mental states
| Mental State | Fleeting                           | Literature           | Permanent                                   |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Active       | brainstorm,jot ideas orgmize inbox | highlight while idle | N/A                                         |
| Lying Down   | read, highlight                    | highlight highlights | N/A                                         |
| Reclining    | brainstorm                         | summarize highlights | N/A                                         |
| Upright      | organize inbox                     | N/A                  | organize tags,/inks, write permanent notes. |
# Finalizing Permanent Notes:
- start with tag index (like **annotated** bibliography but with your notes!)
- rewriting helps crisper your ideas & even spark new ones!
## Metadata
- experiment. Too much → clunky, time-consuming. Too little → risk forgetting & searching later.
- example: Title, Author, Web, Date Created, Date Edited, Tags, note stage (baby, teen, adult)
- Linking vs Tagging keywords
	- linking more prominent
	- one-way linking for simplicity (view backlinks in Obsidian)
