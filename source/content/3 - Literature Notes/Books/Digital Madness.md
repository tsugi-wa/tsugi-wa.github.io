ease with ourselves, rather shock than be alone with our thoughts
attention? iterative dimunition of our choices - frog boil
illusion of choice - but actually narrowin because maniuplated for profit
written by tech career ppl, but feel unease as ppl/parents/etc
**techno-quicksand**, conpulsion, dependency

# introduction
easily write topic or read book frhours on ned, but w/ tech, habit of checking email unhealthy compulsion
now every few hours, hourly, every 15 minutes, etc. "productivity" excuse.
realize need internet to productive but also distracted by social media/notifs
check notifications the moment airplanes hit runway - used to laugh at them

# tally time? 
work only <50% of his time - losing precious family time
	30 min blocks tabulation: >1/3 to work
prevernt vivek from taking care of himself, almost died. now changed job from tech

felt less patient, less empathetic

all phone/web apps, browksers etc seek to max our attention
pattern of tech workers selling to children/ppl while hevily restricting from own family/children
some handle tech better than others!!!! not one-solution  copmlex relationship

VR/AR overwhelming senses can make it even more addictive
Elon Musk - link brain directly to tech, uncharted waters

# Choice - not same as # of choices only
conscious AND subconsciousl.
autonomy or dependency?
