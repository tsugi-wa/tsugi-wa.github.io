Description: My analysis of The Last Wish

##### The Introduction of Geralt and the World through two situations - the striga and Nivellen.

Of course the striga story reminds me of the Bloody Baron quest in the Witcher 3. I find it interesting how curses in this world are always born from intense misfortune and the resulting human hatred, not from some ultimate generic fantasy evil villain who wants to take over the world (maybe I watch too much shallow anime). Sapkowski specifies clearly that the striga curse was not born from incest, but from the stigma and condemning of King Foltest's incest with his sister by others. And Nivellen's curse was brought upon him by his raping of a priestess who likely had the knowledge to cast complex curses. Curses are messy and each one somewhat unique to the situation which give it a grisly realistic feel. It also reminds me of the idea in Supernatural where monsters can be conceived from believing in monsters, and same for the gods' power in Heaven Official's Blessing. 

Twists to fairytales are also a big part of the striga and Nivellen's stories. A redditor claimed that there are many short stories like these two that are inspired by little mermaid, the beauty and the beast, snow white, etc. Nivellen is clearly a twist on the beauty and the beast where true love cures te curse. Yet Verena, the "beauty" is a far greater beast than Nivellen. So why did her death cure Nivellen? And the striga is mostly slavic inspired ([Leslaw in 1847 written by Roman Zmorski](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T02NrgO8Vvs)) but has some hints of sleeping beauty. Later on Renfri with the seven gnomes reminds one of Snow White. 

Not only is there world building - the intertwining of complex human dynamics born from love and hatred with curses and monsters - but also the establishing of Geralt's unique position of authority within all of this as a professional. In both cases, Geralt is pulled aside quietly like a patient's parent would to a doctor and asked to relent his "witcher's code" and break the bad news to them. With the striga, he was asked about the risks and likelihood of the curing plan failing and how the princess would be afterwards. WIth Nivellen, he was asked whether his monstrous condition would inevitably consume him after having more and more ominous, violent dreams. 

Through these intriguing situations, Geralt's extraordinary character is on full display. He doesn't hesitate to cut the bullshit and lay down every fact that he knows and doesn't know even though they may be grim. These questions are clearly very dear to Nivellen and king Foltest's hearts, very painful to confront. And Geralt is strategic and logical - he considers even the scheming path offered to him to kill the striga and lie to King Foltest as a possible card to play before deciding there are no signs of the striga being a lost cause. And then comes his most admirable trait - he ends up curing the curses of both monsters instead of trying to kill them or abandoning them like all the other people in this world have done. The striga was festering and terrorizing for 7 years and even other witchers failed to put an end to the mess. Not anyone had the bravery or the ability to empathize with Nivellen's misfortune which only took Geralt a single encounter to do. When Geralt found Verena to be the cause of innocents' deaths and learned she was controlling Nivellen, he didn't hesitate to turn around, risk his life to kill her for no gain, and spare Nivellen.  

##### Butcher of Blaviken

Wow! I didn't get it the first time around. No wonder people were saying even Netflix's first season was showing signs of defiling the source material. The whole point of Geralt's killing was that it ended up not having to happen technically but was inevitable regardless because everyone involved was helplessly stuck in their ways. The wizard, carried away by the truth of Renfri's mutations to immensely foolish proportions that backfired on him, controlled by a need to feel morally justified and to have control. Renfri, growing up as the victim and incredible survivor of the wizard's horrific actions, forever defined by her thrist for revenge and inability to back down after Geralt "made his choice". There are far more subtler ways in how each of the other characters act that lead to the outcome but is hard for me to keep track. 

In the end Geralt was tempted to make a choice between the two evils out of the inability to sit idly in the face of injustice. This is why he reflects about his first "monsters" being bandits about to rape a merchant's daughter in the voice of reason because he couldn't refrain from interfering as Vesemir suggested, and the realistic, thankless result he got. But here it is clearer that him not acting would've been for the best - Renfri would've never told Geralt she was plotting an ultimatum and that the plan failed because of the wizard's stubbornness because she was set in her ways as well. And in turn Geralt's misunderstanding and inability to sit idle causes everything to spiral into the very destiny Renfri foresaw. This was during their night together where she saw and pitied his stoning and spoke the exact words that would be her last the next day (mutation of clairvoyance).

##### Child of Surprise

Why did Queen Calanthe finally relent and allow Duny to marry Princess Pavetta?

*Now after Geralt saved Duny life and the whole story of his connection to Pavetta (the promise by her father, etc.) was out in the open, she didn't have much choice but agreeing to the marriage, however her noblemen weren't too happy about some ex-monster becoming their new king, so they agreed to Eist marriage to Calanthe so she could keep her position as queen.*

*Because Eist proposes to her which allows her to keep the power (rather than having to cede it to Pavetta's husband). Because for all her blustering she's none too sure she wants to fuck with forces like destiny. The show version of her was ridiculous, stripped of all her cunning and class and regal bearing, her femininity and her sharp wit.*
[[destiny]]
**destiny is not enough:** when Duny comes to "collect" Pavetta, Geralt specifically states that it is allowed as long as Pavetta *also agrees*. Her agreeing is a sign that she is trully destined to be with him so free will is just as important in the decreed law of surprises. 

#### The Deovel

Appearances can be deceiving. 
Geralt tells Dandelion how nowadays most people, with little monsters to fear, blame on made up monsters to feel better about themselves. And also how humans begin to pity monsters or find them nostalgic, as good pets, or worth keeping around for practical reasons (the troll under the bridge). 
Then when Geralt fights the deovel it is hilarious how he tries to instill the "golden rule" in a monster. It is clear the villagers do not want him killed because their local "goddess" the Queen of the Fields doesn't permit it. It is extremely amusing to hear their trickeries and fighting. 
Then we are introduced to the worldbuilding of the elves and the common theme in fantasy of humans "conquering" nature and other races for their own gain. Elves are now trying desperately to fix starvation caused by the humans driving them off their bountiful valley of flowers where food grows abundantly without agriculture. The leader, Filavandrel, appears high and mighty on his white horse but Geralt immediately sees through him and his self-pride in resorting to stealing rather than bartering with humans. Meanwhile, the deovel which looks like a monstrous beast, doesn't want to kill or be a part of the killing of humans, and is willing to sacrifice his life to defend Geralt and Dandilion simply because he doesn't see it as "right".
