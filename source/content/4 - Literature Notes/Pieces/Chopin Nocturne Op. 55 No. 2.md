## Notes

Chopin Nocturne \- form and meaning\!??  
Feeling:

- Key: e flat major sort of rich, warm, noble feel (like Beethoven’s Symphony no. 3\)  
- Yearning, wandering, yet adamant, sometimes unsure  
- More counterpoint/independent melodies than the other handful of his “duet” nocturnes  
- Soaring passionate love, triumphant after hardships  
- ddd

Introduction/barebone facts:

- 12/8 slow but long lines (slurs difficult to maintain)  
- Common to chopin \- lots of tricky **polyrhythm** suggesting free \+ excitement  
- Perpetual motion LH sixteenths UNTIL final phrase  
- Not as frequent referral to old material, ever-lasting melody  
- Harmonic progressions on annotation pdf

Main things I want to touch on:

- Chromatic sliding, constant modulation, and portamento (i.e., major to minor with one note change)  
  - Wandering, struggling through finding its footing in c minor mm. 28  
  - TRIUMPHANT\!  
- counterpoint / duet, uncommon  
- Form: 

1st transition to c minor in m18, lost in m28  
Triumphant after m35

## Essay

[Chopin Nocturne Op. 55 No. 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2Wyl4uI1-M)’s melodic counterpoint atop the atmospheric arpeggios sets up a richly layered character dynamic that alludes to many possibilities of interpretation. The wandering, endless quality of the spacious melody as it drifts freely in and out of intense chromaticism contribute to the piece’s magical, incorporeal quality. However, at the same time, this ethereal beauty is firmly commanded with surprisingly grand, earnest strength, thanks in part to its complex harmonies and massively triumphant ending.  
By beginning with a single, powerful note and ending triumphantly as a full orchestra, the nocturne changes the context surrounding the ethereal, self-discovering body by establishing the entirety of the piece with striking confidence. In this rendition, the instability and yearning of that soprano entrance kicks the whole nocturne into action and continues to dominate while the alto voice gently comments (0:41). Similarly, the arpeggiated bass could be thought of as a single line passed between the bass and tenor, [as beautifully demonstrated by Garrick Ohlsson at 2:27](https://youtu.be/SOsp4igO9NQ?t=147). The decision of how much of each of these chorale-like layers to bring out must constantly be made, but at the same time each voice exists on independent planes. Only later does he bring the alto up to a duet with the soprano at around to really emphasize the increasingly elaborate and insistent counterpoint.  
This nocturne’s form comprises two prominent themes \- one introduced at the opening alone, then two more times with the second theme (introduced at 1:01), somewhat resembling a sonata’s development and double return. When the piece approaches its triumphant, proclaiming return (2:26), the alto voice is noticeably more urgent and ornamented than before. The dynamic between the two voices has now swelled from a dominant and supporting role to a true duet and remains so in the double return. The alto, with its “portamento” chromatic sliding, heavy ornamentation, and 7-to-3 polyrhythm, is now flashier than ever, ascending to near equal status to the soprano (around 3:36). Meanwhile, in the opening, the alto’s fleeting chromaticism in cadences 0:21, 0:35, and 1:58 further convey a fickle, perhaps even mischievous alto character by teetering at the cusp of major and minor or ornamenting in sliding half steps. This subverts expectations of stability in cadencing and makes the piece’s character seem more experimental and determined.   
The duet resembles the soaring and falling of human voices finding their way as many of Chopin’s nocturnes do. Yet, compared with its immediate predecessor, No. 1, it has a far more elusive structure, frequently modulates, and has extensive melodic lines that contrast with No. 1’s distinct, heavily reiterated themes. Also, the rich warmth of the home key help to imbue this piece with an enchanting, uninhibited atmosphere, grounded still with passionate resolve. Scattered throughout are extremely short-lived perfect authentic cadences, such as 0:15 and 2:00, that quickly dissipate back into the constantly molding harmonies, foreshadowing its inner turmoil. Sequences of increasingly suspenseful secondary dominants at 1:00 in preparation for c minor build harmonic drama while remaining timid and uncertain in the melody, quick to shy away from its cadences into tense, new territory. This hints at the intense chromatic instability to come. The melody struggles to find its way through the minor backdrop, venturing out to minor fives (1:40), hauntingly major neapolitans (2:00) and sixths (2:10), and dissonant passing chords (2:30) all with bated breath, in anticipation of a dramatic double return of key and theme. while also grounding the piece’s dreamlike themes with intense yearning and determination.   
The bustling duet following the climax suddenly stops, momentarily exposing the vast, spacious arpeggios and its reassuringly familiar pedal point (4:00). This silence allows the fiery passion of the double return and alto/soprano voices to linger before drifting into the rich harmony, a truly magical transition to the coda. Notably, the modal mixture and striking german augmented sixth harmonies at 4:12 do not invoke uncertainty like in the development; instead it adds intriguing sparkle within the sea of tonic for the melody to drift down like a feather to a grounded, assertive end.

The similarities between the animated [*Dance of the Yōkai*](https://youtu.be/piQpugWN2Xw?t=13) and this nocturne are few and far between, but the uncontainable passion and deeply rooted yearning that the female dancer communicates in her dance, with the male dancer eagerly watching and intermittently responding to her, remind me of the duet dynamic of the nocturne.The female dancer is introduced in 0:13 by bursting the luminous sphere enveloping her with rising gestures, proudly and vehemently declaring her presence to the other dancer against the night (bass) and swirling spirits (the upper registers of the bass arpeggios). Similarly, the nocturne’s raised, sweeping opening immediately commands the audience’s ears in its direction with a brilliance against the deep backdrop. Her leaps and slides in 0:38 pause only momentarily, and after showing the audience the male dancer’s perspective, actively shows how he takes this opportunity to provide an answer move. The short, motivic comments of the alto voice rarely interrupt the soprano, instead actively listening (heh) to the soprano and emerging during its breaths.
