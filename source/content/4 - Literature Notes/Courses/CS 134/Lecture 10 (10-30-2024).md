Replication, primary-backup vs chain
also active vs passive replication strategies (use primary-backup as example)

# Active Replication

- first operation executed on primary
- then replicates operation to replicas which also executes operation
- pros: avoids huge network I/O for huge states
# Passive Replication
- execute opertion ONLY on primary
- replicate result instead of operation to replicas
- pros: avoid expensive computations on replicas, use beefier primary

# Raft - more intuitive Paxos
