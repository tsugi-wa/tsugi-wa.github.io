Julie Weiss, “Feminist Film Theory and Women’s History: Mildred Pierce and the Twentieth Century" Film & History, Vol 22, No. 3, September 1992

- **historical:** (historians, film's year context) 
	- placing the film ;n historical context and looking for how it portrays women characters
	- focused more on portrayal than film structure
	- Walsh: financial success, emotional independence **protofeminism** of WWII
		- audience: post-war america, satisfy men and patriarchy weakened by WWII oversea
		- 
- **theoretical** (sociologists, feminist film theory):
	- using semiotics and psychoanalysis to examine the mechanisms by which film gains its power as a patriarchal system
	- neatly fit in patriarchically-based unconscious
	- representations of women kept in subordinate positions
	- Cook argues ending/plot erases Mildred's voice and reasserts patriarchy 
		- ending: Mildred and Bert walk off passing two women cleaning floor
		- noir detective/murder scenes: suggest masculine danger underworld
		- flashbacks: melodrama light, feminine, constantly undermined by police account (silencing her)
- not mere selfless devoted mother: illicit gigolo, career ambition enjoys

conflict
- historians: 
	- glossing over decade-apart film differences
- sociologists: 
	- 30s and 90s film all make women spectacles of male gaze
- theoreticians:
	- film are painstaking constructions, not reflections of real women experiences
	- psychoanalytic theory
attempts at synthesis
- Linda Williams: Cook + Walsh + historical grounding
- conflict of seeing experiences in film + documented repression in film
- use Frederic Jameson - political unconscious of what is revealed/omitted
	- clues of 1940s (fashion, cars, Ida cracking about good men gone to war)
	- Mildred's career success not applauded like women's war work however
	- purposefully vague, combining fear of women independence from Depression + heroic success during war
- Weiss: longer historical perspective of film over time 1910s-war years
	- 10s-20s: feminists argue for vote, economic, sexual liberation
	- women in workforce surge in 1910s, naturally sexual indepedent too
	- **flappers**, economic free working class women new playground for sex, etc.
	- threatens patriarchy: more "marriage manual" books critiquing husbands in sex and ignorance, standards, marital advisers
		- threatens male "breadwinner" status + social/sexual initiator
		- men feared of no longer being wanted
	- 30s-40s threatened even more by Depression 
		- affected more men than women bc heavy industry
		- unemployment undermined their family authority
	- WWII:  rosie riveter, women proved willing to do men's work
		- apocalyptic view: after war, no more men, women not miss them, society keep going
	- short vs long term view:
		- short: trying to reassert patriarchy after war
		- long: long-term historical struggle for gender authority, hence vague temporal film setting

- punished for economic and sexual independence
	- plot/editing: affair with Monte Beragon, immediately juxtaposed with younger daughter's death
		- also questions her abilities as a mother
	- economic freedom drives Bert away and spoils Veda to poisonous incest/murder/etc
	- **Mom-bashing** : American obsession popular book "Generation of Vipers"
		- "veering towards matriarchy"
		- blame women for destroying husbands to feed their feminine consumer desires and sothering sons
		- damned if you do damned if you don't: smothering children at home, or neglecting to work
			- Mildred neglected Kaet, smothered Veda (grotesque caricature of delinquent motherhood)

## [[Benshoff & Griffin “Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema Actions”.pdf]]
- psychoanlaytic narcissim, voyeurism --> visual pleasure
	- narcississm: self-insert protagonist, great success 
		- male characters, active, aggressive
	- voyeurism: sexual gaze "Peeping tom" feel power over unaware ppl, no 4th wall break
		- female characters: 
- forces heterosexual audience POV "male gaze" otherwise not enjoy film
	- objective/omniscient shot: no character POV (majority of hollywood shots)
	- subjective shot (rarer, stronger psychoanalytic implications)
		- usually by men at women (quattrocentro pov, objective then subjective)
- meta-lvl looking at women - male directors, producers, writers, cinematographers
	- controlling women, positioning them to be viewed
- 3 gazes all inherently male even with female POV:
	- gaze of camera
	- gaze of characters at one another
	- gaze of spectator towards screen
- examples:
	- transformed heroine ("Cinderella" story), men laying eyes on new swan
		- even in women-directed films
		- more carefully prep women than men to be maximally appealing
			- plot-inappropriate sexy clothing
			- meticulously placed "dirt marks"
			- crazy makeup and camera angles to downplay flaws
			- 3-point-lighting, costume to accentuate stars and enhance male gaze
		- roles limited to "looking pretty" or weaponizing sexuality
			- passive, outside story action or even impediment vs men 
			- villain or bad girl characters all impede men (i.e. tripping damsel)
			- ex: two men fight, then both stop to look at passing woman
			- ex: musical number halting story with dancing women
			- ex: animation, bugs bunny, cartoons, aladdin
