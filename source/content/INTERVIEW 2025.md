ok then I want a letter of rec that shows more of my behavioral features i.e.

# Introductions and project/situation/relationship
briefly introduce my GSR, Seungmin (should let her do it)?  then introduce what my role is in her team (what my assigned area in the project is, to analyze, clean, pre-process, and train deep learning models from data (both camera feed video and force + arduino sensors data collected from unity). say role is need CS major AI guy in a lab led by bionics, mechanical engineering professor and herself, etc, to help coding and model training part of the automated fugel-meyer assesssment project for physical therapy. emphasize my role requiring a competent coding RA, 

# good to work with
- great research assistant, brings CS technical expertise to the table as needed for decision making, take the initiative to think, suggest solutions to design problems beyond just my assigned tasks/areas (i.e. suggest improvement to hand sensor prototype based on ideal data for AI, bring to light potential issues in distributed system of cameras/laptops/sensors for data collection)
- very comfortable working with them. good personality, reliable, direct, good communication, quick response. 
# good DO-er
- hard worker, self-driven smart worker clear on logical reasoning to accomplish the task. always seek to understand big picture goal of task (i.e. setting organized, standardized "spec" for all members to abide by open discussion to clearly define inputs and outputs of each stage collaborative help and systems design of the distributed system data collection data flowing path) to improve on initial request and bring to active productive discussion of improvements/changes/finer details on decision-making and design choices, not merely following surface-lvl orders
- very quick learner fix emergency problem on the fly reliable even if not my code part/job/duty/etc do whatever it takes to learn and fix on the fly (i.e. sudden camera multithreading malfunction in code before in-patient experiment appointment, quick response come and fix even though unfamiliar with openCV libraries at the time. brought to light any design considerations GSR should know to discuss, ultimately made important fixes, contributions integral and used in experiments to this day)
- very quickly and easily understand the task/path/etc, efficient, logic, quick response, quick fix if mistake and good comunication, discuss design choices
