### ML Pipeline
**Business Understanding** – What does the business need?  
**Data Understanding** – What data do we have? Is the data clean?  
**[[data preparation]]** – How do we prepare the data for our model?  
**[[modeling]]** – What techniques should we apply to the model?  
**[[evaluation]]** – Is our model the best suited for our problem?  
**Deployment** – How do we make our model available to stakeholders and other users?
