## **Core Principle**
- **Zettelkasten's main folders** maintain consistency and long-term scalability.
- **Subfolders within each type** categorize notes by course or project.
- **Indexes, tags, and links** interconnect notes across subjects and topics.

## **Examples**
### Indexes vs Tags:
```
📁Zettelkasten
  ├── 📁Index 
      ├── 📄AI and ML
      ├── 📄Art Styles
      ├── 📄Cooking
      ├── 📄Piano
  ├── 📁Tags
      ├── 📄seed (infancy)
      ├── 📄fern (teens)
      ├── 📄evergreen (full-fledged)
      ├── 📄active (open-ended)
      ├── 📄todo (missing)
```
- **Indexes**: landing pages linking of relevant permanent notes w/ structure & context 
	- for an example, see [[Piano]]
- **Tags**: categorizers for easy searching
	- of **note status** (\#todo, \#active)
	- or of **maturity** (\#seed, \#fern, \#evergreen)
- **Links:** the heart of it all!
	- in Literature Notes: link to direct sources
	- in Permanent Notes: organic, or like citations in research paper:
		- Ex: *"Chopin’s harmonic innovations, particularly his chromaticism, influenced later composers like Wagner. His works often evoke a sense of longing, aligning with the broader cultural shifts of the **[The Romantic Movement: Zeitgeist and Aesthetic]**."*
	- in Bullet Journal/Todo/meta notes: 
		- planned connections to establish later
		- Ex: *Chopin’s late works demonstrate increased harmonic instability. Further research: **[Harmonic Instability in Late Romantic Composers]**.*

### Books, Articles, Videos, etc.:

```
- **Sources**: copy of source itself (i.e. book pdf) annotated with readwise
- **Literature Notes**: notes on the sources with quotes/highlights 
- **Permanent** **Note**s: own thoughts synthesized from enough literature notes/sources i.e. one section of a research paper, thesis, etc.

```
- Course material is sources
- Lecture/reading notes and assignment progress logs are literature notes
- permanent notes go beyond the division between lectures, courses, and even academia for the goal of grokking the overall field, a corner at a time

## **Why This Structure?**
- Notes remain flexible and not confined within a single course/project. 
- Encourages linking ideas across different fields. 
- Indexes serve as navigation hubs instead of needing redundant notes. 
- Scales better than mainly subject-based structuring.

## **Actionable Steps**
1. **Migrate existing notes** into this structure.
2. **Tag and link important notes** within the Index folder for easier navigation.
3. **Review periodically** to ensure everything remains well-organized and adaptable.
